Your task for today is to parse some text files that your teammates have generated from processing seven segment displays. The files they are generating have the following structure.

You must write a program we can run to process any file that has a number encoded like the one above and print a single line with the number represented by this file. In the case of the example, you should print 1234567890.

Note that every number is composed of three lines, every digit has three columns, and the digits are separated by a space.
